# Welcome

In this document we will be learning three new data structures: `set`, `queue` and `tree`. These are intermediate level data structures and require prior understanding of lists, arrays, dictionaries, tuples, and classes as well as other fundamental data types. We will be using Python to teach these data structures. 

Each section starts with an ***introduction*** followed by an overview of the terminology and methods associated with the data structure found under ***Operations***. Only `tree` does not have such a section. We then then go over how to use these operations in the ***Implimentation*** section which we be followed by several walkthrough problems.

Be sure to check out all the external material as they will be referenced within thier respected data structure sections.
